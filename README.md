Project: Machine learning for detection, classification and forecasting of earthquakes


We have set-up a folder to upload material there, and a list of initial papers (see below) that you can consult to familiarise yourselves with the general topic.

Although the study object are earthquakes, you will not need to learn a lot about earthquakes, but mainly focus on the use AI tools on earthquake data. There is a database of events recorded t different seismic stations in Japan that we have collected and organised for your use.

The main methods that are indicated for testing are Multi-Dimensional Scaling, Convolutional Neural Networks, Convolutional auto-encoders.

I suggest the following topics to investigate more specific directions. These are only indicative, as a variety of methods can be combined together in different ways to solve the same problem.

Note: the general term “Classification” may be more specifically used in “forecasting of earthquakes”, or “detection of earthquakes”, etc. For example, forecasting could be achieved by classifying the time intervals before the earthquakes as ‘precursor’ time intervals.

1. Classify and cluster time series of seismic data, using MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling). See paper of Cliff et al 1995.

2. Classify and cluster time series of seismic data, using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks). See paper of Seydoux et al 2020, thesis of Ong 2021.

3. Classify and cluster time series of seismic data, using data features in time and frequency domain. See paper of Johnson et al, 2020.

4. Classify and cluster time series of seismic data data using convolutional autoencoders. See paper of Snover et al. 2021.
